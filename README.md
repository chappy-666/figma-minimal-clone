This is a frontend-only project that **recreates a Figma design** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## 🎨 Original Design

> This project is based on the following publicly available Figma file:

**Minimal Landing Page Design | Agency Website UI**
🔗 [Minimal Landing Page Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1222060007934600841)

> **Note**:  
> The original Figma design does **not include mobile layouts**.
